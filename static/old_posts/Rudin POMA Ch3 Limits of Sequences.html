The big idea that I missed is that when talking about sequential limits, we are really talking about equality after a certain point. When compared to functional limits, the definition is a little different. Let's look at equality in $\mathbb{R}$.

<b>Equality in the Real Numbers.</b> For real numbers $a$ and $b$, $a = b$ iff for all $\epsilon > 0$, $0 \le |a - b| < \epsilon$.

Now we compare this to the definition of sequential limits and note the similarity.

<b>Sequence and Limit of a Sequence.</b> A sequence is a map with domain $\mathbb{N}$. A sequence $(x_n)$ in a metric space converges to $l$ iff for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \ge N$, $d(x_n, l) < \epsilon$.

The definition says that after a point $N$, $x_n = l$. Now this point of view changes with the definition of functional limits. I can see how using sequential convergence is really the more desired property as it basically means these two things are the eventually the same. Moving on, one really neat result in my opinion is order preserving property of limits.

<b>Theorem. Monotonicity of Limits.</b> For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $a_n \le b_n$ implies $\lim{a_n} \le \lim{b_n}$.

<b>Proof.</b> By hypothesis, $0 \le b_n - a_n$, and then $\lim{b_n - a_n} = b - a$. This means for all $\epsilon > 0$, $-\epsilon < (b_n - a_n) - (b - a)< \epsilon$, and hence $0 \le (b_n - a_n) < (b - a) + \epsilon$. Since this holds for all $\epsilon > 0$, $0 \le b -a$. $\Box$

If we really think about the order preserving property of limits, it is really intuitive. For instance, we can show $a = b$ by showing $a \le b$ and $b \le a$. Since the definition of sequential convergence is really saying these two points are eventually the same, this property is intuitively going to hold. Really interesting stuff!
