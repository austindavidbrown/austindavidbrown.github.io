The motivation is that we want to understand a stochastic process by its local change.
Lets do this in a concrete way using the Langevin SDE.
Let $\Gamma = e^{-V}dm$ where m is Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
Let the local change of the stochastic process $dX_t = -\nabla V(X_t)dt + \sqrt{2} dB_t$ where $B_t$ is $d$-dimensional Brownian motion.
We need to show that solutions exist.

Suppose $V$ is L-Lipschitz with initial value $X_0 \in L_2(\nu)$ where $\nu$ is an initial distribution. Then there exists a unique a.e. and continuous a.e. limit $X_t$ with respect to the Brownian motion filtration $\nu \otimes \F_t$ such that 
\[
X_t = \int_0^t -\nabla V(X_s) ds  + \int_0^t \sqrt{2} dB_s.
\]
and $X_t$ is in $L_2(\nu \otimes \F_t)$.

<i>Proof. </i>
Let $X_0$ be the initial value and
\[
X^n_t = \int_0^t -\nabla V(X^n_s) ds  + \int_0^t \sqrt{2} dB_s
\]
on $t \in [0, T]$ so that $X_t^n$ is a continuous process.
By Lipschitz continuity, we have
\[
f_{n}(T)
= E \max_{t \in [0, T]} \norm{X_t^{n + 1} - X_t^{n}}_2^2
\le L^2 E \max_{t \in [0, T]} \norm{ X_t^{n} - X_t^{n - 1} }_2^2
= L^2 f_{n - 1}(T).
\]
Since $f_0(T) \le L^2 T E\norm{X_0}_2$ and by recursion, we have
\[
E \max_{t \in [0, T]} \norm{ X_t^{n + 1} - X_t^{n} }_2^2
\le L^{2n} \frac{T^{n + 1}}{(n + 1)!}
\]
The right-hand side is summable and thus by Borel-Cantelli, we have that $X_t^n$ is Cauchy a.e. $\nu \otimes F_t$ in the norm $max_{t \in [0, T]}| \cdot |$.
Since this is a complete space with this norm, there is a unique and continuous limit $Y$.
Also, it follows that the limit $Y$ is in $L_2(\nu \otimes \F_t)$.
Using Lipschitz continuity again, we have
\[
\norm{Y - X_t}
\le \lim_n \sup_{t \in [0, T]} \norm{\nabla V(X_t^n) - \nabla V(X_t)}
\le L \lim_n \sup_{t \in [0, T]} \norm{ X_t^n - X_t }
\to 0.
\]
holds a.e. $\nu \otimes \F_t$.

Ito's formula gives a chain rule in stochastic calculus.

<b>Thereom (Ito's Chain Rule). </b>

Let
\[
X_t = \int_0^t -\nabla V(X_s) ds  + \int_0^t \sqrt{2} dB_s.
\]
be a solution with initial value $X_0$ on $[0, T]$.
Let $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ be a $C^2$ function.
Then
\[
f(X_t) 
= f(X_0) + \int_0^t \ip{-\nabla V(X_s)}{f(X_s)} + \Delta f(X_t) ds + \int_0^t \ip{\nabla f(X_s)}{\sqrt{2} dB_s}.
\]
and this is in $L_2$.

From Ito's chain rule, we get an analogous Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Let $Lf(x) = \ip{-\nabla V(x)}{f(x)} + \Delta f(x)$.
Then
Ito's chain rule says that locally on $[0, T]$, we can use dominated convergence (or Fubini) and commute the integrals

\begin{align*}
E(f(X_t)|X_0 = x) 
&= f(x) + E(\int_0^t L f(X_s) ds|X_0 = x)
\\
&= f(x) + \int_0^t E( L f(X_s) | X_0 = x) ds
\end{align*}
This says that $\partial_t E(f(X_t)|X_0 = x) = E( L f(X_t) | X_0 = x)$.
For the same reasoning,

\[
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{E(f(X_t)|X_0 = x) - f(x)}{t} = Lf(x).
\]
