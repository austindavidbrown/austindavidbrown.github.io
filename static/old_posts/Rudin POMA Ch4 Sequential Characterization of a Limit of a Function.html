<b>Theorem. Sequential Characterization of the Limit of a Function.</b> Suppose $X,Y$ are metric spaces, $E \subset X$, $f:X \to Y$, and $p$ is a limit point of $E$. Then

$$
\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = q \label{1}\tag{1}
$$
iff
for every sequence $(p_n) \subset E$ such that $p_n \neq p$ and $\lim{(p_n)} = p$,
$$
\lim{f(p_n)} = q \label{2}\tag{2}
$$

<b>Proof.</b> Suppose (1). Then let $(p_n) \subset E$ satisfy $p_n \neq p$, and $\lim{(p_n)} = p$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. By (1), set $\delta > 0$ such that $\forall x : d(x, p) < \delta \implies d(f(x), q) < \epsilon$. Since $(p_n) \to p$, set $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n : N \leq n \implies d(p_n, p) < \delta$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and suppose $N \leq n$. Then set $p_n = x$, and hence $N \leq n \implies d(p_n, p) < \delta \implies d(f(p_n), q) < \epsilon$.
Conversely, we prove the contrapositive. Suppose (2). Then suppose (1) is false by contradiction. Then set $\epsilon_1$ such that $\forall \delta > 0$ $\exists x$ such that $d(x, p) < \delta$ and $d(f(x), q) \ge \epsilon_1$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then set $\delta_n = 1/n$. Then set $x_n$ such that $d(x_n, p) < \delta_n$ and $d(f(x_n), q) \ge \epsilon_1$. Now, since $f(x_n) \not\to q$, we just need to prove $(x_n) \to p$ and this will contradict (2) and prove the contrapositive. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Then set $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $1/N < \epsilon$. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and suppose $N \leq n$. Then $1/n \leq 1/N$ and $d(x_n, p) < 1/n$ $\leq 1/N < \epsilon$. Therefore, $(x_n) \to p$ and $f(x_n) \not\to q$, a contradiction to (2) as desired. $\Box$

<b>Remark.</b> This theorem was difficult for me. The main idea here is possibly lost I think. The main idea is the map f preserves convergence. This is kind of an algebraic way to think of it, but it clicks with me. I also had a tough time filling out the details of the proof for some reason or another. Hopefully this is pretty clear although I like to use a lot of logical symbols for shorthand.

<b>Corrollary.</b> If f has a limit at p, it is unique.

This is terribly simple as stated in the text, but why not.

<b>Proof.</b> Suppose $f$ has a limit at $p$. Then suppose $\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = L_1$ and $\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = L_2$. Let $(x_n) \to p$. Then $f(x_n) \to L_1$ and $f(x_n) \to L_2$ by Theorem 4.2. Then by Theorem 3.2(b), L_1 = L_2 since $f(x_n)$ is a sequence itself. Therefore, the limit is unique. $\Box$

<b>Theorem. Limit Properties.</b>
These all follow trivially from the sequential characterization.
