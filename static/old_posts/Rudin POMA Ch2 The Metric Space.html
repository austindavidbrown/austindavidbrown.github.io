Again, steering a little differently from Rudin since I seperate things a little differently in my own head.

For some motivation, the idea is to create axioms for the distance and completeness property of the real numbers to study other interesting objects with these properties. So, there is defined mathematical object: a complete ordered field $\mathbb{R}$. Now, algebra already axiomitizes the field object, so the idea is to axiomitize distance and completeness, so we can seperate from the real numbers and study other intersting things. In this post I am basically going to lay out some motivation and a lot of definitions for this object.

<b>Definition. Metric Space.</b>
A Metric Space (X, d) is a set X with the map $d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$,
(i) Symmetry: $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
(ii) Nonnegativity: $0 \le d(x, y)$ and $d(x, x) = 0$
(iii) Triangle Inequality: $d(x, z) \le d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ for all $z$.

This yields axioms for distance.

<b>Definition. Bounded.</b> A subset $S \subset X$ is bounded in a metric space X if there exists an M such that for all $x, y \in S$, $d(x, y) < M$.

<b>Definition. Sequence.</b> A sequence in a set $S$ is a map $x : \mathbb{N} \to S$ by $x(i) = x_i$ with the notation $(x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$.

This is a special case of an indexed family or indexed set.

<b>Definition. Convergent Sequence.</b> A sequence converges to x written $(x_n) \to x$ or $\lim_{n \to \infty}{(x_n)} = x$ iff for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $N \le n$ implies $d(x_n, x) < \epsilon$.

<b>Definition. Cauchy Sequence.</b> $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy Sequence iff for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, $N \le m, n$ implies $d(x_n, x_m) < \epsilon$.

<b>Definition. Complete Metric Space.</b> A metric space X is complete iff every Cauchy sequence converges to some $x \in X$

This yields axioms for completeness, and so this yields axioms for the least upper bound property in metric spaces.

The grand finale..which is the anticlimactic is...duh duh duh!

<b>Theorem. $\mathbb{R}$ with the Euclidean metric is a complete metric space.</b>

<b>Proof.</b> Follows from the definitions.

There is also a definition for continuity in a metric space.

<b>Definition. Continuity.</b> A map $f : X_1 \to X_2$ such that $(X_1, d_1)$ and $(X_2, d_2)$ are metric spaces is continuous at x iff for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x' \in X_1$, $d_1(x', x) < \delta$ implies $d_2(f(x'), f(x)) < \epsilon$.

In conclusion, we created a bunch of definitions to axiomitize distance and completeness (the least upper bound property). Now, the real numbers are a complete ordered field and a complete metric space, but now there can be complete metric spaces that are not ordered fields, and this is all axiomitized for creating or finding new complete metric spaces.
