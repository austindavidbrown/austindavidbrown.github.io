This approach is to estimate the variance using the Markov chain.

<h3>Batch Means</h3>

Let $(X_k)$ be the Markov chain and $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$.
The functional CLT is the motivation here.
Divide the chain $(X_k)$ into $b$ non-overlapping batches so that $n = b m$.
Estimate the batch mean by $B_k = \frac{1}{b} \sum_{i = 1}^{b} f(X_{bk + i})$.
The estimate of the variance of the batch mean is

\[
S^2_{BM} = \frac{b}{n} \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} (B_k - \bar{B_n})^2.
\]

This is not an i.i.d. sample and not consistent in general.
I am not sure what the finite sample properties are here.

<h3>Overlapping Batch Means</h3>

Overlapping batch means overlap and can be consistent. Since I am not concerned with consistency here, I will skip this one.
