The motivation is that we want to solve the PDE called the heat equation where the time change is the average change in space.
The Laplacian $\Delta$ models "average change" in space.
Thus, the heat equation is

\[
\partial_t u_t(x) = \Delta u_t(x)
\]
with initial value $u_0(x) = u(x)$.
The Laplacian $\Delta$ models "average change".

Consider a symmetric random walk with density $p_t(x)$ with time $t$ in discrete steps.
Then the probability for the next step in $t$ is

\[
p_{t + \Delta t}(x) = \frac{1}{2} p_t(x + \Delta x) + \frac{1}{2} p_t(x - \Delta x)
\]

\[
\partial_t u_t(x) = \Delta u_t(x)
\]

If $\frac{(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta t} = 1$, the random walk approximately solves the heat equation.
With initial value $p_0$ , we have that

\[
\frac{p_{t + \Delta t}(x) - p_{t + \Delta t}(x)}{\Delta t} 
= \frac{\frac{1}{2} p_t(x + \Delta x) - \frac{1}{2} p_t(x) + \frac{1}{2} p_t(x - \Delta x) - \frac{1}{2} p_t(x)}{(\Delta x)^2}
\]

is approximately

\[
\partial_t p_t(x) = \frac{1}{2} \Delta p_t(x).
\]

Now, we seek to solve the heat equation by taking a limit of a properly scaled random walk and this will be called Brownian motion.

Interpolate a 1-dimensional random walk with time steps $\frac{1}{n}$ and space steps $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$.
This is
\[
S_{nt} = \sum_{k = 1}^{\lfloor nt \rfloor} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} Z_k + (nt - \lfloor nt \rfloor) \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} Z_{\lfloor nt \rfloor + 1} 
\]
where $Z_k$ are independent standard normal random variables.
Now, $S_{nt}$ is normal with $Var (S_{nt}) = t$ and $E S_{nt} = 0$ and the finite dimensional distributions $(S_{nt_1}, \ldots, S_{nt_k})$ are normal with covariance $E S_{nt_i} S_{nt_j} = t_i \wedge t_j$.
Because this is normal the tails are controlled with
\[
E|S_{nt} - S_{ns}|^4
= 3 (E|S_{nt} - S_{ns}|^2)^2
= 3 |t - s|^2.
\]
Thus, a Theorem by Kolmogorov shows this has a continuous limit with the same finite dimensional distributions. This is Brownian motion. Everything can be extended from the 1-dimensional case, so we only need to prove the 1-dimensional case.

<b>Definition (Brownian Motion). </b>
<i>
A d-dimensional Brownian Motion is a process $W_t$ on a probability space $(\Omega, \F, P)$ over [0, T] where $t \mapsto W_t$ is continuous and $W_{t_1}, \ldots, W_{t_k}$ is Normally distributed with $EW_{t_i} W_{t_j} = t_i \wedge t_j \delta_{i j}$.

<b>Thereom (Existence of Brownian Motion). </b>
<i>
$W_t$ is a limit of $S_{nt}$.
</i>

<br>
<br>

<i>Proof. </i>
By Chebyshev,
\[
P(|S_{nt} - S_{ns}| \ge \epsilon) \le E|S_{nt} - S_{ns}|^{4} \epsilon^{-4}
= 3|t - s|^2 \epsilon^{-4}.
\]
Since $[0, T]$ is compact, we can partition it with $t_1 < \cdots < t_{2^n} = T$.
Then
\[
P(|S_{nt} - S_{ns}| \ge \epsilon) 
= P(\max_{0 \le k \le 2^n} \max_{\frac{T k}{2^n} \le t, s \le \frac{T(k + 1)}{2^n}} |S_{nt} - S_{ns}| \ge \epsilon)
\le 2^{n + 1} 3 T 2^{-2n} \epsilon^{-4}
\]

Now, choose $\epsilon = 2^{-\frac{n}{8}}$ and
\[
P(\max_{0 \le s, t \le T} |S_{nt} - S_{ns}| \ge \epsilon) 
\le 6 T 2^{-\frac{n}{2}}.
\]
By Borel-Cantelli, we have that
\[
\max_{0 \le s, t \le T} |S_{nt} - S_{ns}|
\]
is Cauchy a.e..
Since $t \mapsto S_{nt}$ is continuous by construction and $C[0, T]$ is complete, there exists a continuous a continuous limit $S^*$ on $[0, T] $a.e.
By continuity, the finite dimensional distributions must coincide.
Define the measure $PS^*$ as the measure for the Brownian motion process $(W_t)_{t \in [0, T]}$. $\blacksquare$

Finally, let's solve the heat equation.
Now, $W_t$ is Markov (Easy to show).
Let $f$ be $C^2$.
Because it is Markov, we have
\[
E_x f(W_{t + h}) 
= E_x E_{W_t} f(W_h)
= E_x f(W_{t}) + \frac{h}{2} \Delta E_x f(W_t) + C.
\]
Therefore, with initial value $f(x)$, we can solve the heat equation

\[
\partial_t E_x f(W_t) = \frac{1}{2} \Delta E_x f(W_t)
\]

with Brownian motion. Very rad!
