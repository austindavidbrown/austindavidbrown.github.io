This section is actually super interesting. The topological things about continuity seem to be really nice and exciting. I spent a good bit of time on this since it I feel it is pretty central to the topic.

<b>Definition. Continuity</b> Same as metric space definition.

<b>Definition. Sequential Continuity</b> Same as metric space definition.

The big idea with this is that everything that works for sequences works for continous maps.

<b>Definition. Topological Continuity</b>
$\forall \epsilon > 0$, $\exists \delta > 0 : f(B_{\delta}(p)) \subset B_{\epsilon}(f(p))$.
A little different version is
$\forall B_{\epsilon}(f(p)), \exists B_{\delta}(p) : \forall x \in B_{\delta}(p), f(x) \in B_{\epsilon}(f(p))$

This just gives a much nicer geometric idea of what is going on.

<b>Theorem.</b> Continous maps preserve composition.

<b>Proof.</b> We have to cheat and use Theorem 4.8. Let $X, Y, Z$ be metric spaces, and $f, g$ be continuous maps such that $X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xrightarrow{g} Z$. Let $B$ be an open set in $Z$. Then $g^{-1}(B)$ is open since g is continuous, and $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(B))$ = $(g \circ f)^{-1}(B)$ is open since f is continuous. By Theorem 4.8, $(g \circ f)$ is continuous. $\Box$

This proof is super slick. I saw this in <a href="https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/">Francis Su's awesome lecture series</a>. I think he has a very nice way of explaining things personally.

<b>Theorem. Topological Characterization to Contunuous Maps.</b> Let $f$ map the metric space $X$ to the metric space $Y$. Then $f$ is continuous on $X$ iff $\forall$ open set $B$ in $Y$, $f^{-1}(B)$ is open in $X$.

<b>Proof.</b> Let $f$ be continuous on $X$. Let $B \subset Y$ be open. We need to prove $f^{-1}(B)$ is open, so every point in $f^{-1}(B)$ is an interior point. Let $x \in f^{-1}(B)$. Then since B is open and $f(x) \in B$, $\exists \epsilon_1$ such that $B_{\epsilon_1}(f(x)) \subset B$. Since $f$ is continuous on $X$, and with $\epsilon_1$, $\exists \delta$ such that $\forall x' \in B_{\delta}(x), f(x') \in B_{\epsilon_1}(f(x)) \subset B \implies x' \in f^{-1}(B)$ as desired.
Conversely, suppose $\forall$ open set $B$ in $Y$, $f^{-1}(B)$ is open in $X$. Then we need to prove $f$ is continuous. Let $p \in X$, and let $\epsilon > 0$. Then $f(p) \in Y$. Let $B_{\epsilon}(f(p))$ is open in $Y$. Then $f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(p)))$ is open by hypothesis, and $f(p) \in B_{\epsilon}(f(p)) \implies p \in f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(p)))$. Since $B_{\epsilon}(f(p))$ is open, and with $p$, $\exists \delta$ such that $B_{\delta}(p) \subset f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(p)))$. Therefore, $f(B_{\delta}(p)) \subset B_{\epsilon}(f(p))$, so $\forall x' \in B_{\delta}(p), f(x') \in B_{\epsilon}(f(p))$ as desired. Since $p$ was arbitrary, $f$ is continuous on $X$. $\Box$

This took me a bit to wrap my head around. It actually makes a lot of sense now. As stated in the text, this characterization is elegant and awesome. I even saw in <a href="//www.amazon.com/Topology-2nd-James-Munkres/dp/0131816292?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0">Munkres Topology</a> that it is the definition of continuous maps.

<b>Corollary.</b>
Theorem 4.8 works for closed sets as well.

<b>Proof.</b> Nothing to contribute to the texts' proof.

<b>Theorem. Continuous Maps algebraic Properties</b> Continous maps preserve addition, product, division.

<b>Proof.</b>
Case: $p \in X$ is a limit point. Then $\lim_{x \to p}f(x) = f(p)$,  by Theorem 4.6. Now use the algebraic Limit Properties and this is trivial.
Case: $p \in X$ is an isolated point. Then there is only one point, and the any map defined on that point is continuous at a single point. $\Box$

<b>Theorem.</b>
Skipping all multivariable stuff for now.
