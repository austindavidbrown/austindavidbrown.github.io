I am thinking of ways to organize this blog and trying some new things here and there. I am having a hard time covering so much material in each blog post. Instead, I am going to take the <a href="//twitter.com">Twitter</a> like approach and try to keep posts shorter and about 1 topic at a time out of the text that I am going through. So here goes some stuff about the rationals!

Here are some of the properties of the rational numbers that I find really important. This means I am memorizing them!

<b>Properties of  $\mathbb{Q}$ that are awesome!</b>
1. $\mathbb{Q}$ is an inductive set and an ordered field.
3. $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite!
4. $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
5. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and dense in $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}$ is a seperable topological space.

<b>Theorem. $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.</b>
<b>Proof.</b> Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. Then we use Trichotemy on $a \in  \mathbb{R}$.
Case: $0 \le a < b$. Then by the Archimedean Property, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < b - a$ implies $na + 1 < nb$. With this $n$, define S = $\{ n' \in \mathbb{N} : na < n' \}$. Hence, by Well Ordering Principle, $S$ is nonempty, and there exists $p \in S$ such that $p$ is smallest element of S. Hence, $p - 1 \not\in S$ and $p - 1 \le na < p$ implies $a < \frac{p}{n}$ and $p \le an + 1 < nb$ implies $\frac{p}{n} < b$. Combining the two inequalities, $a < \frac{p}{n} < b$ as desired.
Case: $a < 0$. Then we use Trichotemy on $b \in \mathbb{R}$.
Case: $0 < b$. Then by case 1, there exists $p, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $ a < 0 < \frac{p}{n} < b$ as desired.
Case: $b \le 0$. Then $0 < -b$, and $0 < -a$. Hence by case 1, there exists $p, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $-b < \frac{p}{n} < -a$ implies $a < -\frac{p}{n} < b$ as desired. $\Box$

Well, that finishes this short post. On to the next!
