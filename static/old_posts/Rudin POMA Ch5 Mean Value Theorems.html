For some reason it took me quite a while to get through this section. I still continue to have a difficult time applying MVT and such, but hopefully I will get stronger with practice.

<b>Definition. Local Maximum.</b> If $f$ is a real map on the metric space X then $p \in X$ is a local maximum iff $\exists \delta : \forall p, d(p, q) < \delta \implies f(p) \le f(q)$

<b>Theorem. Interior Extremum.</b> Let $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$, and if $f$  has a local maximum at $x \in (a, b)$, then $f'(x) = 0$.

I took a slightly different approach than the text on this, and I am not entirely sure mine is correct.

<b>Proof.</b> Since $x \in (a, b)$ is a local maximum, there exists a $\delta$ such that for all $d(t, x) < \delta$, $f(t) \le f(x)$. Then if t - x > 0, and by the monotonicity of limits,
$$
\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} \le 0 \implies \lim_{t \to x}{\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x}} = f'(x) \le 0.
$$ If t - x < 0, and by the monotonicity of limits,
$$
\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} \ge 0 \implies \lim_{t \to x}{\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x}} = f'(x) \ge 0.
$$ If t - x = 0, we ignore this since the derivative is a limit, and hence, $f'(x) = 0.$ $\Box$

I will take the reverse steps as Rudin. Instead of going straight to the General Mean Value Theorem, I am going to use the ideas from Rudin's proof and incorporate it into a proof of the regular MVT.

<b>Theorem. Mean Value Theorem.</b> Let $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and differentiable on $(a, b)$. Then there exists an $x \in (a, b)$ such that
$$
(b - a)f'(x) = f(b) - f(a).
$$

<b>Proof.</b> We need the equation
$$
(b - a)f'(x) - (f(b) - f(a)) = 0
$$
to hold, so we create a map such that the derivative is the LHS above, and hence define $h(x) = (b - a)f(x) - x(f(b) - f(a)).$ Now, $h'(x) = 0$ for some $x \in (a, b)$ is exactly what we want. Hence, $h$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, and by the Extreme Value Theorem, there exists an $x_1 \in (a, b)$ such that for all $x$, $h(x) \le h(x_1)$, and hence $f$ has a local maximum at $x_1$. Then by the since $h$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$ by properties of derivatives, and by the Interior Extremum Theorem, $h'(x_1) = 0$ as desired. $\Box$

<b>Theorem. General Mean Value Theorem.</b>
I will skip this proof since I have nothing to add to the texts' proof.
