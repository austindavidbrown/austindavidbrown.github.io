Today, is to finish up the topic of countability at least for now. For motivation, the goal is to use apply the stuff from the previous post to prove $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. To start, there are two really useful theorems from Munkres [2] that make life very easy. I will write them out here without any proof since it is kind of complicated and Munkres does a great job.

<b>Theorem.</b> Countability Criterian from Munkres [2]. The following are equivalent:
(i) S is countable.
(ii) There exists a surjective map $\varphi : \mathbb{N} \to B$
(iii) There exists a injective map $\varphi : B \to \mathbb{N}$

<b>Proof.</b> I really like Munkres proof [2].

<b>Theorem.</b> A finite cartesian product of countable sets is countable.

<b>Proof.</b> Let $\Phi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by $\Phi(m) = (m, n)$ is surjective by definition. Then let $A, B$ be countable sets, and hence there exists two bijective maps $\psi : \mathbb{N} \to A$ and $\omega : \mathbb{N} \to B$. Next, define $\Lambda : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{A} \times \mathbb{B}$ by $\Lambda(m, n) = (\psi(m), \omega(n))$ is surjective by definition. Hence, $\Lambda\circ \Phi : \mathbb{N} \to A \times B$ is surjective, and hence $A \times B$ is countable. Next, the remaining inductive argument for $n$ cartesian products is trivial and in Munkres [2].

<b>Theorem.</b> A countable union of countable sets is countable.

<b>Proof.</b> The idea is to use the cartesian product. Also, I really like Munkres [2] proof!

<b>Theorem.</b> $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.
<b>Proof.</b> Let $\mathbb{Z} = \{ 0 \} \cup \mathbb{N} \cup -\mathbb{N}$ is a countable union of countable sets. $\Box$

<b>Theorem.</b> $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.
<b>Proof.</b> Using Example 3 from Munkres [2], define $\varphi : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q_+}$ by $\varphi(m, n) = m/n$ is surjective by definition. Then since $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$  is countable, there exists a surjective map $\psi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. Hence $\varphi \circ \psi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q_+}$ is a surjective map implies $\mathbb{Q_+}$ is contable . Next, $\mathbb{Q} = \{ 0 \} \cup \mathbb{Q_+} \cup -\mathbb{Q_+}$ is a countable union of countable sets. $\Box$

<b>Theorem.</b> $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.
<b>Proof.</b> Skipping for now.

This was a rough topic for me. I am glad it is over. I was able to get some good practice in with indexing a set with an index map. Also, I found a new appreciation for some of Munkres [2] exposition.
