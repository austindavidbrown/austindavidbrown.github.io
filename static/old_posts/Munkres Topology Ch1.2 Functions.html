This is a total derail. While running through Rudin's POMA, I ran into a problem where I really did not understand how maps behave over unions and intersections. I realized I needed a better grasp on the image and preimage concepts before finishing Theorem 4.14 in <a href="#">Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis</a>. The section in Munkres was very well done, so I worked through it and here are some brief notes that I find to be really important.

<b>Definition (Image and Preimage).</b> Let $f : A \to B$. Then $f(A) = \{ b \in B : f(a) = b, \exists a \in A \}$ is the image of $A$ under $f$ and $f^{-1}(B) = \{ a \in A : f(a) \in B \}$ is the preimage of $B$ under $f$.

Some important concepts I had trouble getting my head around. We lose information about the domain in the image of $f$. In contrast, we do not lose information with the preimage $f^{-1}$. In a way, we can get information the domain of $f$ with $f^{-1}$. The image of $f$ never gets larger. The preimage of $f$ gets larger since we lose information about the domain in the image of $f$.

Munkres gives these examples but it gives a nice idea of the concepts above. $(f \circ f^{-1})(B) \subset B$ and $A \subset (f^{-1} \circ f)(A)$. These are simple if we know $f$ never gets larger, so this explains the first equation, and $f^{-1}$ does get larger, so this explains the second. This helps easily explain why the identities in the exercises are the way they are. I feel the concepts in this post were the toughest for me personally. Now, back to Rudin!
