Oh my!! This topic kicked my butt! At some point, I just need to move on and revisit the topic later. I think this topic is very interesting and quite confusing. I am going to practice some enumeration problems as they are fun. Let's get started!

<b>Definition. Countability infinite.</b> A set S is countable iff there exists a bijection from $S$ to $\mathbb{N}$.

We stray from the book a bit and use the definition from Munkres.

<b>Definition. Countable.</b> Finite or countably infinite [2].

It would be very odd if subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ were not countable. For me, this is very intuitive, but here is the next theorem. I came across something I find rather interesting. How do I sort any subset of the natural numbers? I still do not have a nice solution to this, but the problem is very interesting to me coming from a computer science background.

<b>Lemma.</b> All subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ are countable.

<b>Proof.</b> Let $U \subset \mathbb{N}$. If $U$ is finite, then we are done. Suppose $U$ is infinite. Then since we do not know $U$ is ordered, we enumerate $U$ with an index map. Since $U \subset \mathbb{N}$, let $U = \{u_i\}_{i \in I}$ such that $I \subset \mathbb{N}$. Then $u_1 \in U$, and since $U$ is infinite, for all $i \in I$, $u_i \in U$ implies $u_{i + 1} \in U$ implies $I = \mathbb{N}$ by induction. Hence, $U = \{u_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$. Next, we prove the index map is a bijection. For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \not= n + 1$ implies $u_n \not= u_{n+1}$ since $U$ is infinite, and hence the index map is injective. Next, for all $u \in U = \{u_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$, $u = u_i$ for some $i \in \mathbb{N}$ implies the index map is surjective. Hence, the index map is bijective, and $U$ is countable. $\Box$

<b>Theorem.</b> All subsets of a countable set are countable.

<b>Proof.</b> Let $A$ be a countable set. Then there exists a map $\varphi : A \to \mathbb{N}$ is bijective. Let $B \subset A$. If $B$ is finite, we are done. Suppose $B$ is infinite. Then let $\psi = \varphi \circ \iota_B : B \to \psi(B)$ such that $\iota_B$ is the inclusion map, and hence $\psi$ is bijective. Since $\psi(B) \subset \mathbb{N}$, $\psi(B)$ is countable, and there exists an $\omega : \psi(B) \to \mathbb{N}$ is bijective. Hence, $\omega \circ \psi : B \to \mathbb{N}$ is a composotion of bijections and is a bijection. $\Box$

Now this theorem implies that intersections will be countable since they are subsets. Next, we need to figure out unions of countable sets and cartesian products of countable sets to really apply this stuff. I ran out of time today, so I will stop here and finish up tomorrow.
