<b>Exercise 1.</b>
Let $S$ be any set. Then $x \in \emptyset$ is vacuously true implies $\emptyset \subset S$. $\Box$

<b>Exercise 2.</b>
Using the hint, define that set to be $S_N$. Then $\bigcup S_N$ is a countable union of finite sets and hence is countable.

<b>Exercise 3.</b>
Suppose all $\mathbb{R}$ numbers are algebraic by contradiction. Then by Exercise 1, $\mathbb{R}$ is countable, a contradiction.

<b>Exercise 4.</b>
Suppose by contradiction $\mathcal{I}$ is the irrational numbers and is countable. Then $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q} \cup \mathcal{I}$, but unions of countable sets are countable, a contradiction. $\Box$

<b>Exercise 6.</b>
(a) We prove $X \setminus E'$ is open by showing for every $x \in X \setminus E'$, there exists an neighborhood of x in $X \setminus E'$. Let $p \in X \setminus E'$. Then $p$ is not a limit point of $E$ means there exists $r > 0$ such that $B_r(p) \cap E = \{ p \}$. Now, we show $B_r(p) \subset X \setminus E'$. Suppose $B_r(p) \not\subset X \setminus E'$ by contradiction. Then there exists an $x \in B_r(p)$  such that $x \notin X \setminus E'$ means $x$ is a limit point of $E$. Now, since $x$ is a limit point of $E$, choose $r$ such that there exists $q \in B_r(x) \cup E$ such that $q \not= x$. But $B_r(x) \cap E = \{ x \}$, a contradiction. Hence, $B_r(p) \subset X \setminus E'$ means $X \setminus E'$ is open. $\Box$

(b) Since the closure is the smallest set containing the limit points, this is clear.

(c) TODO

<b>Exercise 7.</b>
Routine.

<b>Exercise 8.</b>
(a) No, the set may not be bounded.
(b) No, since the set might not be bounded.

<b>Exercise 9.</b>
(a) For all $x \in \text{Int}(E)$, by definition, $x \in F \subset E$ such that $F$ is open in $E$. Since $F$ is open, there exists an $r > 0$ such that $B_r(x) \subset F \subset E$. By definition, $\text{Int}(E)$ is open.

(b) Suppose $\text{Int}(E) = E$. Then $E$ is open by (a). Conversely, suppose $E$ is open. Then we prove $\text{Int}(E) = E$. Hence, $\text{Int}(E) \subset E$ by definition. Conversely, for all $x \in E$, since $E$ is open, there exists an $r > 0$ such that $B_r(x) \subset E$, and hence $x \in B_r(x) \subset \text{Int}(E)$. Therefore, $\text{Int}(E) = E$. $\Box$

(c) $G$ is in $\text{Int}(E)$ by definition.

(d) For all $p \in Int(E)^c$, $p \not\in Int(E)$ means for all $r > 0$, there exists a $q \in B_r(p) \cap E^c$, and this means $p \in \overline{E^c}$. The converse is similar.

(e) False, intuitively $E$ and $\overline{E}$ can be 2 very different sets. The rationals contained in the reals is the goto counterexample.

(f) False, intuitively $E$ and $\overline{E}$ can be 2 very different sets. The rationals contained in the reals is the goto counterexample.

<b>Exercise 10.</b>
This is the discrete metric, so skipping.

<b>Exercise 11.</b>
(a) False, fails triangle inequality
(b) True
(c) False, fails nonnegativity; $|(-x)^2-x^2|=0$ but $-x \not= x$
(d) False, fails nonnegativity; $|x-2x| = |x| \not= 0$
(e) True

<b>Exercise 14.</b>
$\bigcup_n (-1 + 1/n, 1 - 1/n)$ covers $(0, 1)$. Suppose a finite subcover exists by contradiction. Then $\bigcup_n (-1 + 1/N, 1 - 1/N)$ for some $N$ covers $(0, 1)$, but $1 - 1/n$ such that $n > N$ $\not\in \bigcup_n (-1 + 1/N, 1 - 1/N)$, a contradiction.

<b>Exercise 19.</b>
(a) Since $A, B$ are closed, $A = \overline{A} \implies \overline{A} \cup B = \emptyset$ and $B = \overline{B} \implies \overline{B} \cup A = \emptyset$, so by definition, it is a seperated.

(b) Define $E = A \cup B$, and is seperated by definition.

(c) Define $E = A \cup B$, and $A, B$ are open by construction. this is seperated by definition.

A second approach. Suppose $A \cup B$ is connected by contradiction. Suppose $\overline{B} \cap A = \emptyset$. Then since $A = B_\delta(p)$, then $\overline{A} = \overline{B_\delta(p)}$, and hence $\overline{B_\delta(p)} \cap B = \emptyset$, a contradiction.

(d) I have to use IVT here for fun. Let $p, q \in X$ such that $p \not= q$. Define $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ is a bijection. Then there exists $f(x)$ such that $f(q) < f(x) < f(q)$ for all $f(x)$ in this interval by IVT. Since any nontrivial interval in $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, $X$ is uncountable.

<b>Exercise 20.</b>
We claim the interior $\text{Int}(X)$ will fail with a counterexample for certain constructions. To show this, let $X$ be connected. Then $\text{Int}(X) = \bigcup \{ U : \text{U is open in X} \}$. Then $\text{Int}(X) = \text{Int}(X) \smallsetminus U_N \cup U_N$ for some $U_N$, so it can be expressed as the union of two disjoint open sets.

We claim the closure $\overline{X}$ is. Suppose it is not connected by contraiction. Then $\overline{X} = U \coprod V$ such taht $U, V$ are open. But the union of open sets is open, a contradiction.

<b>Exercise 22.</b> Since $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$, and is countable, $\mathbb{R}$ is seperable. Since the finite cartesian product of countable sets is countable, $\mathbb{Q}^k \subset \mathbb{R}$ and is countable.
