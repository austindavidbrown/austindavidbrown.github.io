<b>Exercise 2.</b>
(i) Let $f(x) \in f(\overline{E})$. Then we show $f(x) \in \overline{f(E)}$. Let $r > 0$. Then since $f$ is continuous, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $f(B_{\delta}(x)) \subset B_r(f(x))$. Since $x \in E$, choose $\delta$ such that there exists $q \in B_{\delta}(x) \cap E$. Then
$$B_{\delta}(x) \cap E \subset E \implies f(B_{\delta}(x) \cap E) \subset f(E)$$
and
$$B_{\delta}(x) \cap E \subset B_{\delta}(x) \implies f(B_{\delta}(x) \cap E) \subset f(B_{\delta}(x)) \subset B_r(f(x)).$$
Hence, $f(q) \in B_r(f(x)) \cap f(E)$, and this means $f(x) \in \overline{f(E)}$. $\Box$

(ii) Suppose it did. Then let $f(a, b) = (a - 1/n, b + 1/n)$ for all $n$. Then
$f(\overline{(0, 1)}) = f[0, 1] = \overline{(0 - 1/n, 1 + 1/n)} = [-1, 2]$ , but $[-1, 2] \not= [0, 1].$

<b>Exercise 3.</b>
I had to look this one up and I feel silly after doing it. Since $0$ is closed and $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(0)$ is closed, and this is exactly the set defined in the problem.

<b>Exercise 4.</b>
(i) Suppose $\overline{E} = X$. Then show $\overline{f(E)} = f(X) = f(\overline{E})$. By exercise 2,
\begin{align}
f(\overline{E}) &\subset \overline{f(E)} && (1) \\\
f(E') &\subset f(E)' && (2)
\end{align}
Hence, $E \cup E' \subset X$ implies
$$
f(E \cup E') = f(E) \cup f(E') \subset f(E) \cup f(E)' = \overline{f(E)} \subset f(X) = f(\overline{E}).
$$

(ii) Suppose for all $p \in E$, $f(p) = g(p)$. Let $x \in X \smallsetminus E$. Since $E$ is dense in $X$, x is a limit point of $E$ by construction. Then there exists $(p_n) \subset E$ such that $(p_n) \to x$. Hence,
$f(p_n) = g(p_n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis implies
$$
\lim{f(p_n)} = \lim{g(p_n)} \\\
f(x) = g(x
$$ by continuity of $f, g$. $\Box$

<b>Exercise 5.</b>
(i) Suppose $E$ is bounded. then $\inf{E}, \sup{E} \in E$ and exists, so define
$$
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
f(x), & x \in E \\\
f(\inf{E}), & x < \inf{E} \\\
f(\sup{E}), & x > \sup{E}
\end{cases}
$$
and hence $g$ is continuous by construction. Suppose $E$ is bounded below or above only, then we modify $g$ easily. Finally, suppose $E$ is not bounded, then $f(x)$ is itself an extension. $\Box$

(ii) If it is not closed the sup, inf can cause a discontinuity.

(iii) Works fine for vector valued functions, I think.

<b>Exercise 9.</b>
We just unwrap the definition. For all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $E \subset X$, and for all $p, q \in E$,  $d(p, q) \le \text{diam}(E) < \delta$ implies $d(f(p), f(q)) \le \text{diam}(f(E)) < \epsilon$. Nicer definition I think.

<b>Exercise 11.</b>
(i) Let $\epsilon > 0$. Then since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $p, q$, $d(p, q) < \delta$ implies $d(f(p), f(q)) < \epsilon$. Since $(x_n)$ is Cauchy, there exists $N$ such that for all $n,m \ge N, d(x_n, x_m)< \delta$ implies $d(f(x_n), f(x_m)) < \epsilon$ since $f$ is uniformly continuous.
(ii) I am not sure how to do this one.

<b>Exercise 12.</b>
Let $f \in UC(M_1, M_2)$, $g \in UC(M_2, M_3)$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Since $g \in UC(M_2, M_3)$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $s, t \in M_2, d(s, t) < \delta$ implies $d(g(s), g(t)) < \epsilon$. Also, since $f \in UC(M_1, M_2)$, there exists $\delta_2$ such that for all $p, q \in M_1, d(p, q) < \delta_2$ implies $d(f(p), f(q)) < \delta$ implies $d(g(f(p)), g(f(q))) < \epsilon$. $\Box$

<b>Exercise 13.</b> I am not entirely sure this is correct.
Since $f \in UC(E, \mathbb{R})$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $\text{diam}(E) < \delta$ implies $\text{diam}(f(E)) < \text{diam}(f(\overline{E}) = \text{diam}(\overline{f(E)}) = \text{diam}(f(X))$ by exercise 4. Since $\overline{f(E)} = f(X) \subset \mathbb{R}$ and is closed, by exercise 5, there exists  a continuous extension of $f(X)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and since $f(E) \subset f(X)$, it is also an extension from $E$ to $X$.

<b>Exercise 14.</b>
Let $\varphi(x) = f(x) - x$. Then $\varphi$ is continuous on $[-1, 1]$, and $[-1, 1]$ is connected implies there exists $x$ such that $\varphi(x) = 0 = f(x) - x$. $\Box$

<b>Exercise 16.</b>
Every integer should jump to 0.
