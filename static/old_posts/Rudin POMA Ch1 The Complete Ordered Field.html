Too much to say with so little space to write! Ok, Rudin has a great opening chapter. In fact, one of the best preliminary openings to any text probably. This post is basically just going to lay out definitions of stuff. I will skip the proofs and things since I have done them so many times already. I want to spend more time on some of the Topology posts. Now on to the good stuff!

<b>The Properties of $\mathbb{R}$.</b>
1. $\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$
2. $\mathbb{R}$ is an inductive set.
3. $\mathbb{R}$ has the the Archimedean Property.
4. $\mathbb{R}$ is a field, so has field axioms
5. $\mathbb{R}$ is totally ordered, so order has the trichotemy property, transitivity property.
6. $\mathbb{R}$ is complete, so has the Axiom of Completeness property.
7. $\mathbb{R}$ is a complete ordered field.
8. $\mathbb{R}$ is isomorphic to any other complete ordered field.

TADA! The real numbers have so much structure it is so beautiful.

<b>Definition. Ordered Set.</b> An ordered set $(S, <)$ is a set with the relation $<$ with the trichotemy and transitiviy axioms.

It is interesting that $\le$ is defined as $<$ or $=$, so there is nothing more to do with this symbol.

<b>Definition. Supremum.</b> $S$ is an ordered set that is bounded above. There exists an $\alpha \in S$ such that $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $S$ and for all $\gamma$, $\gamma$ is an upper bound of $S$ implies $\alpha \le \gamma$.

Interesting to note that supremum exists only on ordered sets. I actually thought it needed to be an ordered field for some reason.

<b>Definition. Field.</b> A field is a set $S$ such $(S, +), (S, \cdot)$ form 2 Abelian groups and $S$ have the distribution axiom.

This is more of an algebraic way of thinking about it, but it is easier for me to organize things personally.

<b>Definition. Ordered Field.</b> A field that is an ordered set.

From what I have noticed, there are different ways to handle the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$. Rudin uses the construction of $\mathbb{R}$ with Dedekind cuts, and there is also the construction with Cauchy sequences, but I have not seen this one yet. Personally, I like the axiom. The reason for this is we need an complete ordered field type in math in my opinion, so just make it an axiom. However, Rudin uses Dedekind cuts to Construct the Reals. I watched <a href="https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/">Francis Su's</a> lectures on the topic while skimming through the proof and found his explanation quite great to say the least.

<b>Definition. Axiom of Completeness.</b> Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a supremum.

<b>Theorem 1.19. Completeness of the Real Field.</b> There exists an ordered field with a least upper bound property.

Also, as Rudin states at the end of his chapter, any two ordered fields with the least upper bound property are isomorphic. This means we can just work in $\mathbb{R}$ and make an isomorphism to some other complete ordered field.

This next property is extremely useful for proving some sequence stuff in Chapter 3.

<b>Definition. Archimedes Axiom.</b> Let $S$ be an ordered field. The following are equivalent:
1. For any $x \in S$, there exists an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > x$.
2. For any $x \in S$ with x > 0, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $1/n < x$.

Rudin states the property a bit differently, and I am not really sure why.

<b>Theorem. $\mathbb{R}$ has the Archimedian Property.</b> For all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists an $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $n > 0$ such that $nx > y$.

<b>Definition. Extended Reals.</b> $\mathbb{R}$ and $+\infty$, and $-\infty$.
The main idea here is that $+\infty$, and $-\infty$ are symbols that have axioms. I won't copy the axioms from the text.

I was going to write about the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, but I think I will wait for Topology to tackle the topic of denseness. To Topology I go!
