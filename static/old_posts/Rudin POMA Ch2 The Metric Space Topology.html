Ok, so now that we have a metric space object, this thing generates a topology on the space. To say this succinctly: the metric $d$ generates a topology on the space $X$. Now, for a bunch of definitions.

<b>Section. Open subsets.</b>

<b>Definition.</b> An open ball is defined $B_r(x) = \{ y \in X : d(y, x) < r \}$.

<b>Definition.</b> The set $S$ is open iff for all $x \in S$, there exists a $B_r(x) \subset S$.

<b>Theorem.</b> The metric forms a topology on the metric space X.
(i) $\mathbb{R}$, $\emptyset$ are open.

<b>Proof.</b> These are open by definition.

(ii) For any family of open sets $\{ S_i \}_{\alpha \in A}$, $\bigcup_{\alpha \in A} S_\alpha$ is open.

<b>Proof.</b> For all $x \in S_{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$, there exists a $B_r(x) \subset S_{\alpha} \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} S_\alpha$. $\Box$

(iii) For any finite family of open sets $\{ S_i \}_{1 \le i \le n}$, $\bigcap_{1 \le i \le n} S_i$ is open.

<b>Proof.</b> Let $x \in S_i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$. Then there exists a $B_{r_i}(x) \subset S_i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$. Let $r = \min{\{r_1, ..., r_n \}}$. Then we can choose the minimum since this is finite. Hence, $B_r(x) \subset S_i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$. $\Box$

<b>Theorem.</b> The following are equivalent:
(i) $A$ is open in $M$.
(ii) $A = Int(A)$.
(iii) $M \setminus A$ is closed.
(iv) For all $p \in M$, there exists $N(p) \subset M$ where N(x) is a neighborhood of x.

<b>Proof.</b> TODO

Ok, so now we can deal with open subsets.

<b>Section. Closed subsets.</b>

This gives us the definition of closed sets in a metric space.

<b>Definition.</b> The set $M \smallsetminus A$ is closed in $M$ if $A$ is open in $M$.

<b>Definition.</b> A closed ball is defined $\overline{B_r}(x) = \{ y \in X : d(y, x) \le r \}$.

<b>Theorem.</b> A closed ball is closed.

<b>Proof.</b> TODO

<b>Definition.</b> The closure of $M$ notated $\overline{M}$ is $\bigcap\{ E \subset M : E \text{ is closed} \}$.

<b>Definition.</b> The element $p$ is a limit point of $M$ iff for all open balls $B_r(x)$, there exists $q \in B_r(x) \cap M \setminus \{ x \}$.

<b>Theorem.</b> The closure $\overline{A} = A \cup A_L$ such that $A_L$ is the set of all limit points of $A$.

<b>Proof.</b> TODO

<b>Theorem.</b> The following are equivalent:
(i) $A$ is closed in $M$.
(ii) $M \setminus A$ is open.
(iii) $A = \overline{A} = A \cup A_L$, so $A_L \subset A$

<b>Proof.</b> TODO

Ok, so now we can deal with closed sets.
